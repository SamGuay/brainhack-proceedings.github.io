# The Brainhack Proceedings Journal

Brainhack Proceedings is a community driven, free and open publication venue, that welcomes a variety of Hackathon Outcomes, Projects & Education (HOPE).
We are open to the community to join us as authors, reviewers and developers to build and run the Brainhack Proceedings all together.

The journal website is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/brainhack-proceedings/brainhack-proceedings.github.io), as is the entire submission and review process.


You can find information about [paper submission](https://brainhack-proceedings.github.io/submit) and the [review processes](https://brainhack-proceedings.github.io/review) on our website. 
For information about general paper guidelines and our Code of Conduct, please head over to the [Brainhack Proceedings Doc](https://brainhack-proceedings.readthedocs.io).
